Olympic Games Data Analytics Using Apache Spark and Databricks


As part of my data analytics journey, I worked on a project analyzing Olympic Games data using Apache Spark within Databricks Notebook (Community Edition). This project allowed me to apply big data processing techniques to explore and derive insights from a dataset covering the modern Olympic Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016.
