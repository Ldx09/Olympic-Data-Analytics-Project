# Olympic Games Data Analytics Using Apache Spark and Databricks
As part of my data analytics journey, I worked on a project analyzing Olympic Games data using Apache Spark within Databricks Notebook (Community Edition). This project allowed me to apply big data processing techniques to explore and derive insights from a dataset covering the modern Olympic Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016.

# Project Overview: This project focused on data ingestion, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization using Apache Spark and SparkSQL. By leveraging Databricks, I was able to efficiently handle large-scale Olympic datasets, uncover trends, and create compelling visualizations to present my findings.

# Key Components of The Project
1. Data Ingestion & Preprocessing
   Loaded and cleaned Olympic datasets for structured analysis.
   Used SparkSQL and DataFrames for efficient data transformation.

2.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   Analyzed trends in athlete performances, country rankings, and medal distributions.
   Examined historical patterns across different Olympic events and sports categories.

3. Scalable Data Processing
   Implemented Apache Spark for fast and efficient big data processing.
   Optimized queries to handle large datasets seamlessly.

4. Visualization & Reporting
   Developed graphical representations of medal counts, athlete performance, and country-wise statistics.
   Created interactive dashboards within Databricks Notebook for insightful data storytelling.

5. Real-World Impact
   Answered key questions related to athlete dominance, country rankings, and historical trends in Olympic sports.
   Demonstrated how big data analytics can be applied in sports, media, and data science industries.
